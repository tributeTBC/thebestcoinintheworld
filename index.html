                    <p>
                        In an age long past, when the digital realm of the blockchain was
                        still a vast, uncharted expanse, there existed two companions, Jack
                        and Kyle. These were not ordinary wanderers; they were developers,
                        architects of code, etching their vision into the indelible fabric
                        of the blockchain. Their quest was nothing short of monumental - to
                        birth the most exemplary coin the world had ever seen.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On an eve of destiny, under the spectral glow of countless lines of
                        code, they toiled in a marathon of creation. The room, bathed in the
                        harsh, electric blue light, was a crucible where something
                        extraordinary was taking shape. Abruptly, from the tangled labyrinth
                        of their screens, a figure began to emerge. It was a luminous,
                        holographic manifestation of the elusive entity known only as
                        Satoshi Nakamoto.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The figure spoke in cryptic riddles and complex equations, guiding
                        their hands and minds to the climax of their creation. In the
                        chilling silence that followed, the glow from their screens cast
                        long shadows across their awestruck faces. They had done it. They
                        had created the best coin the world had ever seen.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, if you dare to ask Jack and Kyle to recount the tale of the
                        best coin in the world, they might falter. The exact specifics have faded with time, blurred by
                        the excitement of
                        invention and the exhaustion of their endeavor. What was once considered the best coin in the
                        world now existed as a hazy memory, its details elusive and faint.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Yet, they will assure you of one thing: while it may no longer hold the title of the best coin
                        in the world, it remains a powerful tribute. A tribute to the limitless potential
                        of the blockchain, a homage to the power of human ingenuity. A tribute to their relentless quest
                        and the extraordinary journey they had embarked on.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And that coin, that gleaming testament to their quest, was merely
                        the opening chapter of their grand adventure. An adventure that,
                        even now, is only just beginning.

                    <p>In the wake of the coin's creation, its allure stretched across the digital landscape, luring in
                        all who dared
                        venture into the realm of the blockchain. Yet, this was no ordinary coin. It was a masterpiece
                        of code, a testament
                        to human ingenuity, and it bore a unique, enigmatic trait, a curse known as: </p>
                    <p style="text-align:right"><b>"The Curse of
                            the
                            Weak Hands"</b>.</p>

                    <p>This curse was an intricate part of the coin's design, imprinted deep within its indelible
                        blockchain fabric.
                        Whenever the coin changed hands, a fee was extracted, a tribute to the coin's inherent value and
                        a reminder of its
                        creators' original intent: to encourage long-term belief in their creation.</p>

                    <p>But there was a way to lift the curse. If a holder possessed the coin for exactly 42 hours, a
                        seemingly arbitrary
                        duration yet imbued with a veiled significance, the curse would be broken, and they could then
                        pass on the coin
                        without the customary fee.</p>

                    <p>However, should a holder succumb to the lure of immediate profit and relinquish the coin before
                        the designated time,
                        the curse would renew itself. The countdown would reset, and the 42-hour wait would begin anew
                        for the new holder.
                    </p>

                    <p>In a fascinating twist, the curse had a finite lifespan. Once only 21 billion coins remained, the
                        curse would be
                        permanently lifted. This feature was a testament to the coin's ultimate scarcity and the balance
                        between creation
                        and preservation.</p>

                    <p>As Jack and Kyle watched their creation make its way through the intricate networks of the
                        digital world, they knew
                        their adventure was far from over. They had merely set the stage for a grand saga in the annals
                        of the blockchain, a
                        saga that was only just beginning.</p>

                        deepest
                        valleys, with their resolve unbroken in the face of countless trials and tribulations.</p>
                    <p>When the journey seemed most dire, they discovered a forgotten shrine, filled with echoes of the
                        past. It
                        was here that they found a parchment bearing the inscriptions of an ethereal coin - the luminous
                        token
                        they had been searching for. This token, created by a lone developer out of the ashes of
                        devastation and
                        hardship, was said to have the power to unlock unimaginable wealth.</p>
                    <p>Strengthened by their discovery, they returned to the ancient chamber, holding the ethereal coin
                        high in
                        their hands. As it met with the light from their torches, it shimmered with a glow that
                        reflected off
                        the ancient walls, illuminating inscriptions that had previously remained hidden. It was the
                        Tribute
                        token, the key to the age-old machine. </p>
                    <p>With newfound hope and determination, they used the token. The machine stirred to life, revealing
                        the
                        precious Tribute they had fought so hard to attain. And so, they became not only the bearers of
                        the
                        Tribute but the bearers of a new era. </p>

                        <div class="question">Question: Is it safe to use Tribute token?</div>
                        <div class="answer">Answer: The Tribute token is designed with security in mind. The token
                            contract has been carefully
                            audited and does not have any mint or abusable functions. The only function available is
                            the
                            Whitelist, which is
                            used to add current and future liquidity pools. This ensures that buyers are not
                            affected by
                            diminishing tax fees.
                            Additionally, the Whitelist function allows us to add exchange wallets, ensuring that
                            tax
                            rules do not impact their
                            withdrawals and transactions, allowing us to easily comply with their regulations.</div>

                        <div class="question">Question: What is the total supply of Tribute tokens?</div>
                        <div class="answer">Answer: The total supply of Tribute tokens is 42 billion, inspired by
                            the
                            famous phrase "The
                            answer to life, the universe, and everything." In a playful homage to this concept, the
                            token supply has been
                            set to 42 billion. The Tribute ecosystem implements a deflationary mechanism through
                            taxes.
                            If non-burned (dead
                            address) tokens reach 21 billion, which is half of the initial supply, the tax is
                            completely
                            removed. This means
                            that the tax feature creates deflationary pressure until only 21 billion Tribute tokens
                            are
                            left in circulation.
                            This design ensures the scarcity and value preservation of the remaining tokens.</div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <div class="question">Question: How does the tax mechanism work?</div>
                        <div class="answer">Answer: Whenever someone sends or receives Tribute tokens, a diminishing
                            tax
                            rate comes into
                            effect. It starts with a total tax fee of 10% and gradually decreases to 0% if you can
                            hold
                            the tokens for 42
                            hours. This mechanism, known as the "Curse of the Weak Hands," discourages short-term
                            trading and promotes
                            long-term holding. It also helps combat bots, as they would be subject to the maximum
                            tax
                            rate if they attempt
                            to manipulate transactions. If you don't send or receive Tribute tokens for 42 hours,
                            you
                            can make a transaction
                            with no fee applied. It's important to note that every send or receive of Tribute tokens
                            resets this 42-hour
                            timer.</div>

                        <div class="answer">
                            Answer: This token is the labor of love and resilience by a single, hobbyist Solidity
                            developer who found
                            strength in adversity. I was faced with the devastating loss of my life savings and home
                            due to a severe
                            earthquake in Turkey. It was a chapter of hardship and despair. But amidst the rubble, I
                            found a spark of hope
                            and determination. That's when THE BEST COIN IN THE WORLD was born. During these
                            challenging times, I had
                            moments of solitude which gave me a chance to create and contribute something to the
                            world. This token is more
                            than just a project for me; it's a testament to human resilience and the will to rise
                            even when the odds are
                            against you.
